# Start new empty project in Django 

## Tasks

1. In terminal create directory 'exercises-django' and get into it. 

   **For all exercises you'll need only this one folder!**

2. Create virtual environment with name suggested by teacher (for example 'my-env').  

3. Activate virtualenv.  
After activation of virtualenv you should see in console its name in parentheses, for example: 
   >(my-env) artur@artur-MSI:~/Desktop/DCI/exercises-django$

4. Install Django in this virtualenv.  

5. Create list of installed packages and.  

6. Start new project 'mysite' in Django using django-admin.   
The dot at the end of the command is important, it represents current folder!  


7. Run development server.  
For now, don't worry about red warnings about migrations. This topic will be covered later.

8. Open link ```http://127.0.0.1:8000/``` in the browser. If you dont's see errors -congratulations!
